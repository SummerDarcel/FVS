# Ani-Mates!

## Summary: 
Pet Finder is a lighthearted app which allows you to get matched up with your perfect pet, based on questions you answer about what you want in a pet.

## What it does: 
The user will answer questions, then behind the scenes, the user gets matched with pets in a database.  Let's face it, although people want pets, some shouldn't!  That gets captured as well.  The database can be updated with new pets, and you can even search for adoptable pets in your area using your zipcode!

## Code: 
This app uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, Databases, Node, Express, curl, and is deployed to Heroku.  We use Travis CI with Linter and follow MVC filing.
