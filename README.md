Pet Finder is an app which allows you to get matched up with your perfect pet, based on questions you answer about yourself.

The user will answer questions, then behind the scenes, the user gets matched with a pet based on a complex algorithm.  Let's face it, although people want pets, some shouldn't.  That gets captured as well.

This app uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, Databases, Node, Express, hides keys, user authorizations, and is deployed to Heroku.  We use Travis CI with Linter and follow MVC filing.
